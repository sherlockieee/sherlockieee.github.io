            <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
            <p>
              I'm Ha. Originally from Hanoi, Vietnam, I am now doing software engineering @ Robinhood, and Computer
              Science major @ <a href="https://www.minerva.edu/">Minerva University</a>. In the past, I've lived in 5
              countries (Vietnam, Singapore, US, Germany and UK), and finger-crossed, 2 more next year (Argentina and
              Taiwan).
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in the power of the tools we use to solve complex problems. My favourite tools currently
              include: <a href="https://figma.com/">Figma</a>, <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a>, and{' '}
              <a href="https://projectmeta.netlify.app/">Heptabase</a> (that I was somehow a part of ... strange).
            </p>
            <p>
              I think we need more people work on important things, such as solving climate change. I'm especially
              interested in carbon sequestration using enhanced weathering with olivine, and the intersection between
              web3 and ReFi. Shoot me an email if you want to chat!
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, I love reading and try to maintain an active list{' '}
              <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50839792-ha-tran-nguyen-phuong">here</a>. I also plan to
              donate 10% of my income to{' '}
              <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/best-charities-to-donate-to-2021/">effective charities</a>, and
              write about software, climate, tools for thoughts and any other things I enjoy. So if you're interested in
              any of these things, you have come to the right place!
