This year I managed to read 43 books, behind my target by 7. One thing that I implemented this year was to give myself permission to drop a book whenever I feel like it. This has been great, because now I genuinely just read books I really enjoy, and never feel the guilt to push on. The downside though is there are quite a few books that I’m at least half-way or two-third through that I could have finished and added to the total count. But I want reading to be something I enjoy long term, and having this “permission” for myself is what will help ensure it. And all in all, I’m pretty proud of my totals considering also how busy the year has been for me.

Also, because I only read books I enjoy, I have a much longer list of books I loved. I have highlighted them here so that if anyone need recommendations for 2022, maybe they will find one of these books interesting.

## Best book of the year

If there’s only 1 book I think everyone should read, it’s **[Nonviolent communication](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71730.Nonviolent_Communication).** Only after reading it do I realize how violent my communication can be, even with me actively trying to not hurt the other person. I have learnt techniques that have changed how I communicate, to make me a kinder, better communicator. I’m still struggling to apply this technique, but I can feel myself understanding my needs and others better, and as a result facilitate the conversation better. I will definitely revisit the book and its concepts again and again. Truly, I think the world will be a better place if everyone reads this book.

## Best Fictions

![Pachinko](http://prodimage.images-bn.com/pimages/9781455563920_p0_v4_s1200x630.jpg)

1. [Pachinko](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34051011-pachinko?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=c5ScDBMgYB&rank=1).
    
    This is a long, long book, but I was hooked every page. It’s about Korean history as it intertwines with Japan, World war and Korea war told in the perspectives of a long-standing family with several generations. 
    
2. [Everything I never told you.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693763-everything-i-never-told-you?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=tsmxvj2vOs&rank=1)
    
    This is a story about a dysfunctional family and how they learnt to heal after the sudden loss of their daughter. I read it when my family was going through a pretty tough time ourselves, and it provided a good escape from reality. I finished it in one sitting.
    
3. [The mind-body problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74787.The_Mind_Body_Problem?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=6d9XEReVee&rank=1).
    
    To be honest, I read it at the beginning of the year so I already forgot most of the book. I only remember that I loved the book and finished it so quickly, and made a point to read more fictions throughout the year (which I kept...kind of). 
    

## Best Non-fictions

![Netflix and the culture of reinvention](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71KCwxodiJL.jpg)

1. [Non-violent communication.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71730.Nonviolent_Communication)
    
    See above. So good.
    
2. [Hell yeah or no.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52523856-hell-yeah-or-no?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=dvYdiQPTAC&rank=2)
    
    The name sounds kind of cheesy so I procrastinated reading this for a long time, but I found many unexpected gems throughout this book. Somehow the author takes a lot of simple concepts and flip it on its tails to give a fresh new perspectives that I’m able to relate immediately. Some chapters that I love: Local vs Global, Action reveals our values; Switch strategies in your career.
    
3. [The beginning of infinity.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483171-the-beginning-of-infinity?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=L3yDxpoiIr&rank=1)
    
    It connects the concept of infinity in many disciplines, with the main argument that progress is infinitely possible when we commit to good explanations. Not only has it made me more optimistic of the future, it has also inspired me to seek and create better explanations which have come in handy a lot more than I expected. Definitely long and dense (don’t listen to the audiobook!), but worth reading for sure.
    
4. [Storyworthy.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37786022-storyworthy)
    
    The book is about how to tell better stories. You would think it’s a niche thing, but then when you realize that we communicate and remember in stories, we need to learn to do it better to remember our lives to be more interesting and colorful. This book teaches us how to do that. I also realize as I’m writing that I didn’t really take note and incorporate these things a lot, and plan to do so soon.
    
5. [Netflix and the culture of reinvention.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49099937-no-rules-rules)
    
    It was a fascinating story of how Netflix started and how it has endured its culture since, told by the founder and CEO of Netflix (and also sponsor of my e d u c a t i o n yooo). Reminds me of the phrase, “Every successful business succeeds in a different way, every failed company fails in the same way.” I don’t think Netflix business model is easy to replicate, but it does teach valuable lesson about what matters. Also it really makes me want to work for Netflix because it seems like the best possible environment to learn and grow.
    

## Honorable mentions

In no particular order: Come as you are, Three women, How to not die alone, The cosmic serpent, How to take smart notes, Refactoring UI, How to win friends & influence people.

## 2022 Book Goals

I hope to read 50 books in 2022 again, and with the same permission to drop books I don’t feel like it. I also hope to:

- Read more books on climate (only read 1 this year)
    - Read How to avoid a climate disaster
- Read more books on software (only read Refactoring UI and The Effective Engineer this year)
    - Read Head First Design Patterns
    - Read Designing Data Intensive Applications
- Have more random books that I just want to explore! (Like Cosmic Serpents) + Get recommendations from friends (like The Tao of Pooh, Cosmic Serpent, etc.)
- Go to bookstores more often. A lot of cool books (Three women, Normal People, etc.) I found were when I just did book window-shopping :))

If you have made it this far, firstly, thank you, and secondly, I have two requests:

1. If you think there’s a book I’ll enjoy, please shoot me an email me at phuonghatrannguyen00@gmail.com. I can’t guarantee I will read it, but I will definitely read the synopsis and decide whether I will add it to my TBR pile.
2. If you read regularly, please join Goodreads, rate the books you read and [add me as a friend](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50839792-ha-tran-nguyen-phuong)! I love going through (translation: stalking) people reading list and finding new  books. I also think it’s a pretty cool community to be a part of.

That’s all. Happy 2022!
