Last semester, I didn’t join my cohort for my usual rotation city in London and instead was in San Francisco doing an internship. It was not the easiest time, but it was a growing experience. In the process, I have learnt what is important to me, and what I want to prioritize in my life. Hopefully my reflection  is useful for anyone who’s evaluating a new chapter of their lives, be it choosing college or living in a new city.

## Prioritize being with the right people

Being with the right people is life-changing - so go out of your way to live close to them. This is especially true for family and relationship, but also friendship, mentors, and community.

 There’s something about being part of the right group, being with the right people, that make doing hard things a lot easier. Case in point: I’ve been running for a while now, and my pace usually hovers around 11 minute/ mile for a 5k. In Seattle, I found a social running group and started going weekly. With the group, I jumped to a 9 minute/mile pace, cutting nearly 5 minutes of my runtime. When I’m surrounded by people who are better, I learn from people and try to be better - and not just in these runs alone. I now feel a lot less inclined to skip my solo and long runs, because I want to "do my part" to be better in the group. 

A good way to judge people, and community, is what I’ve learnt from Ava’s bookbear express’s post “[safety](https://ava.substack.com/p/safety)”: 

> This is how I evaluate relationships:
> 1. Can we make each other feel safe?
> 2. If so, can we challenge each other?
> 

Prioritize being around people who make you feel comfortable, loved and supported, but also challenge you to be the best version of yourself.

## Prioritize doing work you love

This is closely related to 1 - doing work you love involve for a large part working with people you admire. But it also has different aspects to it.

The first part is "flow". It's a mental state that comes when you are fully immersed and energized in an activity. If you love coding, you know this feeling when you are deep in the process of building something new. But it can also come when you dance, write, skateboard, and more. Like Kelly Wakasa says, it's "do what excites". 

But that's not the end of it. After my Robinhood internship, I’ve learnt that I want to 1. Build product; 2. Be close to end user and 3. Align with the company’s mission. This was surprising: I used to think that as long as I’m in the flow through coding i.e. doing 1, I would be satisfied with my work. But it turns out that to spend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week on something I'm are not excited about, in a codebase that is layers of layers of abstraction away from the end result, is not fun for me. I’ve learnt to rank both impact and purpose high on my list for my next job. 

This is ultimately personal: I know people who love technical problems, others who love working with many stakeholders, and some who only want to do tactile things. And some people just want a chill job to enjoy life afterwards. There's so many ways to find a job you love. Regardless, experiment and reflect to find what work you love doing, what work feels like *play*. Then prioritize that.

## Prioritize financial freedom

I don't want to de-emphasize the importance of money. We all need it and most people would benefit to have more of it. But I find that people often make money the end-all-be-all goal, which I think is stupid.

Money is important to the extent it can free you to do what you want. Beyond that, it’s all the factors above that end up matter more. Money is a medium of exchange and store of value - money in itself is worthless. It is what it gets you that matters. So rather than optimize for dollars in your bank account, optimize for a good life. This means spending money liberally on the things that make your life good: books, dinners with friends, traveling, good gym, healthy delicious food, maybe even a flight across the country to see a loved ones. Put the dollars where you think bring the most value in your life.

## Prioritize good weather, sunlight, places with nature

Being in Seattle, it’s the first time I see sunset at 10 pm (the sun sets at 6-7 pm year round in Hanoi). I finally get why [Sam Altman says, “Summers are the best”](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short). It makes a marked difference in my happiness being surrounded by good weather and nature, so much so that I think it’s worth the 7% state income tax to be in California sun year round. I want to spend on my happiness.
