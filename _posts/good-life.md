*Status: Drafting, open to discussion*

Last semester, I didn’t join my cohort for my usual rotation city in London[1] and instead lived in San Francisco for a semester doing an internship. It was not the easiest time, but it was a growing experience. 

In the process, I realized what is important to me, and what I want to prioritize in my life. I think this is useful for anyone who’s evaluating a new chapter of their lives, be it choosing college or living in a new city.

## Prioritize being with the right people

I cannot highlight this enough. Being with the right people truly lift the tides - so go out of your way to live close to them. This is family, but also friendship, mentors, and larger community. For instance, if you want to live and breathe start-ups, the extra rent in San Francisco might be worth the effort. There’s something about being part of the right group, being with the right people, that make everything that is hard a lot more effortless. Case in point: I recently started running with a social group. While I’ve been running for a while now, my pace usually hovers around 10.30 - 11 minute/ mile for a 5k. With the group, I jumped to a 9 minute/mile pace, or cutting nearly 5 minutes of my runtime. When I’m surrounded by people who are better than me, I feel the need to strive for and learn from everyone. I think that makes a big difference in progress.

A good way to judge people, and community, is what I’ve learnt from Ava’s bookbear express’s post “[safety](https://ava.substack.com/p/safety)”: 

> This is how I evaluate relationships:
> 1. Can we make each other feel safe?
> 2. If so, can we challenge each other?
> 

Prioritize being around people who make you feel comfortable, loved and supported, but also challenge you to be the best version of yourself.

## Prioritize doing work you love

This is closely related to 1 - doing work you love involve for a large part working with people you admire. But it also has different aspects to it that might not be as obvious for first glance.

After my Robinhood internship, I’ve learnt that I want to 1. Build product; 2. Be close to end user and 3. Be excited about the company’s mission. This was surprising: I used to think that as long as I’m learning new things i.e. doing 1, I would be satisfied with my work. But it turns out that to spend 8 hours a day, 5 days a week on something you are not excited about in a codebase that is layers of layers of abstraction away from the end result - that is not fun for me. I’ve learnt to rank both impact and purpose high on my list for my next job hunt. 

It’s different for each person though - I know people who love technical problems, others who love working with many stakeholders, and some who only want to do tactile things. Regardless, experiment and reflect to find what work you love doing, what work feels like *play*. Then prioritize that.

## Prioritize financial freedom

This is worth talking about: money is important to the extent it can free you to do what you want. Beyond that, it’s all the factors above that end up matter more. Money is a medium of exchange and store of value - money in itself is worthless. It is what it gets you that matters. So rather than optimize for dollars in your bank account, optimize for a good life. This means spending money liberally on the things that make your life good: books, dinners with friends, traveling, good gym, healthy delicious food, maybe even a flight across the country to see a loved ones. Put the dollars where you think bring the most value in your life.

## Prioritize good weather, sunlight, places with nature

Being in Seattle, it’s the first time I see sunset at 10 pm (the sun sets at 6-7 pm year round in Hanoi). I finally get why [Sam Altman says, “Summers are the best.”](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short) It makes a marked difference in my happiness being surrounded by good weather and nature, so much so that I think it’s worth the 7% state income tax to be in California sun year round. I want to invest in my happiness.
