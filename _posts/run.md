*For runners and aspiring runners. If you put one feet after another at any speed, welcome to the club.*

I have never been athletic. Growing up, the only exercise I did was badminton and biking around the small university behind my house (and in case you didn’t know, Vietnamese universities are probably the size of a US high school). In 7th grade, we were supposed to run maybe 2 rounds around a football field (800 meters?) and my lungs were screaming by the end. Running was a nightmare.

It continued being a nightmare for a while. In 9th grade, we needed to run 2.4 km to pass our P.E lessons. I remembered being the last one on the track, almost passing out by the end of the test. But we needed to do the same test 4 years in a row, so every year around February, I would drag myself onto the tracks in the bright hot sun and push myself to just pass that test. I think I got a D in the end.

I stopped running once I went to college and only picked up in 2020, restarting this journey with a Couch to 5K plan. I was half walking, half running for the first month. But then I could start running for 5 minutes, then 10, 20, 30 and 35 minutes. I was finding my grove. 

And then I moved back to Vietnam and we were stuck in quarantine because of COVID and it was hot so I stopped running. And then I went to Berlin and restarted running but my knees hurt after 3 runs so I stopped. And then I went to San Francisco and started going to the gym and just forgot about running for a while.

But there was something about running that kept pulling me back. I remembered distinctively my first run in San Francisco. I was in my room, having a full blown crisis - my head kept spiraling into negative thoughts, and no matter what I did, I couldn't get away from that fog. So I grabbed my shoes and hit Market Street. I legitimately ran away from my problem.

I could barely breathe after 15 minutes. But it didn’t matter. The fog went away. My mind quietened down. All the chatter stopped. For a moment, my mind could focus on nothing else but bringing one foot after the next.

I have kept running since.

Some people run to get a runner high. Other run to lose weight, to improve their appearance, to keep fit. I love all of these things about running. But that’s not why I run.

I run, as Murakami describes, to acquire a void. To get to a moment where all the anxiety and chatter and distracting thoughts quieten down, and I can just focus. On one foot after the other, on the physical sensation of my body, on the heavy breath that goes in and out of my lungs. One step at a time. One breath at a time.

I’m most free when I’m running. Free from the world, but also free from my thoughts. In a moment, I can just be. 

Running is my form of meditation.
