# Engineering is a mindset, not a skill

üéâ¬†I just moved to Seattle! Will be here for the summer. Reach out if you‚Äôre around!

The most recent adventure I had as part of my move-in is to assemble a standing desk, and an office chair. After a ridiculously long time, I have managed to make them both functional, and can now officially call myself an engineer. In the process though, assembling furniture reminds me a lot about the engineering mindset.

When people ask me about software engineering, they often ask about concrete skills: which language to learn, which tech stack to use, or what Leetcode questions to grind ü§Æ. And while they are important, no doubt, I‚Äôve since learnt that engineering is more than a set of skills: at its core, it‚Äôs about solving problems. And this is a mindset, because it translates to more than the software we build while staring at the screen. Case in point: the standing desk I‚Äôve built.

Like the start of any project, I opened the boxes with great excitement, ready for the challenge. The instruction manual took some time to figure out (but was still a lot clearer than most API documents), and soon enough, I was putting screws and putting pieces together.

About two-third ways through, I needed to put a rod in-between the table. That part was really unclear from the document - so I did what any software engineer would: I turn to to Google. After watching a short tutorial from the manufacturer maybe 20 times, I bootstrapped the solution and marched on. Very quickly after, the table came together.

Excited, I tested my table. But low and behold, only one side of my table was moving up. Thank god I was smart enough to not put anything on the table yet (imagine if my laptop was there). This was when troubleshooting happened: did I miss a step? Was there additional wire connecting the two sides somehow? But my hunch was that third step: maybe I put the rod wrongly which did not cause the motor to turn properly. 

Reluctantly, I removed the top I have already screwed in, but because of this I could see clearly that one side of the rod was spinning, while the other wasn‚Äôt, and the spin was what caused the leg to go up and down. So I took it out, tried a bunch of ways based on how I observed the other side to function, and after what seems like infinity, it worked! Both sides were spinning, and my desk now has the same height for each leg. I took photos, like all proud mothers, and proceeded to share it with social media, like all millennials.

Maybe my software engineer friends can understand the sprinkles of jokes and the point I was getting at, but this can be confusing for others. Where is the engineering mindset that I was referring to?

But in many ways this is the typical process that all engineers go through: I build something, I run into problems, I make hunches and test it out, I hopefully find where the problem comes from, I fix the problem, and the cycle continues. If this sounds simple enough, it‚Äôs because it is. It‚Äôs something everyone of us is doing in our day to day life. The differences lie in the approach: learning to break the problem down to sub-problems, and testing the components to see if our guesses are correct. Engineers are just people who are better trained at problem solving, or in my case, more stubborn and unwilling to give up than most people are.

This might sound like a skill more than a mindset - but I think it‚Äôs the opposite. Because more than anything, it requires an inquisitive mind to keep poking at things, to assemble and reassemble things in different ways, and to not give up when the going gets hard. And it‚Äôs a love for building - whether a physical thing like my standing desk story, software that lives on the cloud, or systems in our daily life. When we treat problems not as a negative thing, but as potentials for solutions, that‚Äôs when we have the engineering mindset.

It sounds like I write this to tout my own horns. I assure you I‚Äôm not (except for flexing my standing desk, that part I‚Äôm freaking proud of). 

A peculiar thing happens as I get into software - people start making comments: ‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt software engineering so hard?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not suitable for girls like you.‚Äù, ‚ÄúI think you can do software in the short run, but should transition to learn something less difficult in the long run.‚Äù And while I am now in an environment that nurtures and supports my growth, for a long time that wasn‚Äôt the case. I think 13-year-old me, who was last in her math exam, would appreciate this message: it‚Äôs not about the skills or knowledge. It‚Äôs about the willingness to learn, endurance to challenges, and excitement to build.
