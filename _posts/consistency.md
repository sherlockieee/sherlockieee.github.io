One thing I find very interesting about general productivity gurus on how to create is: they usually emphasize public-facing quantity. Create one video a week for a year! 1 tik tok a day! 3 instagram posts a week!

It’s not a bad heuristic. I’m doing it myself with this blog: I try to write at least 1 article a month. In general, it’s fair to assume that most people take far too long to get started, and don’t put in enough efforts once they do. They start too late and quit too early. But I also see the downside with focusing on this quantity-based public-facing approach.

I have this thought as I’m sitting in the middle of the night, jumbling words while writing out another article as I promise myself I would every month, only to find myself on the last day possible scrambling to put together thoughts and ideas. A lot of them feel half-baked, most of them meandering without clear conclusions. I get the output I’m looking for, but is it the right way of approaching it?

This reminds me of arts and how people create them. Most artists are extremely disciplined - writers often spend the entire morning in front of their typewriters, painters would spend hours experimenting with different painting styles and strokes - but the output varies. Some are very prolific (Vincent Van Gogh creates a painting nearly every day), others rarely create anything (Da Vinci only produces 20 paintings in his lifetime). Many leave projects abandoned and manuscripts unfinished. 

Perhaps in today’s world of productivity gurus, these same artists would be shamed for the inconsistency in their output.

I encounter something similar as I’m working on my capstone. I set a fixed time each week, and for each session, would open my code terminal and dive straight in. Some days were great - I built the feature I wanted, maybe even an additional bug fix or two; others not as much. I would be banging my head against the wall for 2 or 3 days in a row for the same bug that I have been staring at, trying the 10th different iteration of random answers I found on StackOverFlow. But the point is, each day as I opened my laptop, I just had a rough idea of what I would do, but I really had no, no idea how long it would take, what the direction would be, and what I would end up doing.

I think it’s similar for creative projects. 

There are ideas that you keep tinkering with, day in, day out, whether in your subconscious mind, or in the words you have written, or any other form of expression, that just … refuse to make itself known. So you need to bang your head against the wall, tinker with something else, randomly mention it in conversations, and slowly, piece by piece, the idea gets fully formed in the essay, the poem, the story. But it only happens after wrestling with it for a long time, drafting and redrafting, and muling over this. It’s a process that you come in every time not knowing what would come up, except in the moments that you sit there and try to wrestle with all those thoughts. 

In other words, you can’t control the outcome, but you can control the process.

So perhaps, a better heuristic instead of “[insert output] a [insert time frame]” would be, “spend X [amount of time] daily/ weekly on Y [the thing you want to create]”. Give space and time for the idea that comes from your head, play around with it and poke it in various ways, and see what comes out. The time you spend is not wasted. It adds up to something, even if you don't recognize it right now.
