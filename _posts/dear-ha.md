I read this [interesting article](http://nickcammarata.com/writing/two-experiments-2019) a while ago where one of the experiments the author has really intrigued me: every week, I would carve out some time in the evening, and write down what I want my past self would want to know. It gives me some space for reflection, of who I want to be, and whether I'm on that path, or straying somewhere else. 

I have been trying it for a grand total of 2 weeks, so there's nothing life-changing yet. And while I won't share everything I wrote here, because most of them are quite personal, I think there are snippets that I want to share with the world.

"Dear Ha,

I hope you know that you’re learning and growing every day, and you are trying to be a better person. I’m happy and proud of you.

What I’ve learnt this week:

1. Ukraine went to war with Russia. I got that feeling again where I just felt completely useless, and there’s nothing I can do. I donated and I bought food for my roommate, but I struggled to do anything more. I’m tired and I don’t want to look at the news, knowing it will depress me, but I also try to be informed of what’s going on. I’ve learnt that:
    - There will always be things outside of our control, in this case, a terrible, horrifying war; and
    - We get to choose our response to it.
    
    Regardless of what happened, we get a choice. I feel that with a lot of Ukrainians, who chose to stand up for their country, who chose to speak up, who chose a different lifestyle to cope with this insurmountable stress. I saw it in my friends who put in efforts and care for people around them, who go to protests and make food for others. I saw it in the Ukrainian leaders who chose to stay in the war when they could have left. I saw it in so many places, and it makes me determined that if all these people are able to do it in the darkest of times, I can do it too. I hope I remember this, that I always get a choice."
