I love reading. I also happen to watch a lot of Youtube. What I've noticed is that I don't stumble upon insights on Youtube the way I do on random blogs or books. This is weird since I usually spend (an embarrassingly) more time on Youtube than reading. Given the sheer amount of exposure, you would expect that I've learnt more from Youtube. But that doesn't seem to be the case.

My theory is, people don't spend as much time thinking about what they are presenting on Youtube as they do writing. Don't get me wrong - Youtube is a lot of work. But to present on the camera means forgoing a well-crafted script to sound natural, and perhaps replacing deeper insights with more diluted worldviews for the sake of algorithms. Meanwhile, when I sit down to write, I assume an audience of one - myself. I am forced to think and rethink my sentences, to write, then delete, then attempt again. Whatever point that could take a person speaking 5 minutes to say, I need to try to do that in 1 sentence. 

Because of this, unrelated points get sieved out. Insights crystallize. So even though the entertainment value drops by a few points, the real value increases.

This is the first part of creating insights. Writing is an act of introspection, first and foremost. When I write, I write first for myself. When I talk, I talk to an audience. Writing allows me to immerse in my own thoughts a lot better than speaking does.

But then again, some of my best insights come from talking to others. This is what happen when I engage in a meaningful conversation - where one idea gets discussed, dissected, and strengthened as two people take turn to examine it. Hearing another perspective opens a world that I was previously unaware of. It's exhilarating - ideas get thrown around, molded, and shaped differently each time I discuss it.

I think this value comes from feedback - discovering something the person said, then making the connections with my own context, and sharing this to get more information. This is probably the second reason why Youtube falls short - we are listening, but we aren't actively creating the connections with our existing context. So even if the person said something insightful, the brain doesn't have enough time to absorb and connect it to its existing network, thus we fail to create meaning.

So insights come from retrospection and feedback. It is a cycle of yin and yang: We think deeply about something, then we throw it out to the world, our neighbor or friend. That insight gets molded and connected with other information, which then becomes the source of information for us to engage in. Then us think again, and share again, and continue on.

If that doesn't sound familiar, it shouldn't be. We have all encountered it before, but we just don't realize it. When I first learnt CSS, I was engaged in pure feedback, but no retrospection. I would copy the code and paste it in, praying that it would work. If it didn't, I would try the next thing on the list. Yet I never tried to understand CSS under the hood. Only later when I was incredibly frustrated with the language did I take time to learn how it works. Then suddenly, everything started to make sense. I could write code that I could actually understand, and consequently, debugged better, and wrote better code. So even though I had had plenty of feedbacks (visual cues, StackOverFlow, etc.) previously, I could never fully make sense of what I've learnt, until I introspected and understood the sources.

And the opposite happened as well. When I started writing, all of it was private (beyond the occasional essays for my mom to post on her Facebook, but it's a long story). I was confident with my ability to write, but only when I wrote my personal essay for college did I realize how much more I had to improve. Up until then, all the writing was in my head, for myself. Thus, I would meander unnecessarily, and forgot other important details because they were a given to me. In listening to my friend's feedbacks and drafting the essay multiple times, I finally found a version that, while imperfect, was much better than the original. Had I kept my writings to myself, that transformation, with however introspection, could not have existed.

So to create more insight: sit with your thoughts. Write. Think. Then throw it out and listen to people, intently. Absorb everything you will. Then sit with those thoughts. Try to mold them until you get something new. Repeat the process.
