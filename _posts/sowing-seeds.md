"The past 2 weeks have been crazy. Someone just refered me to work for an artist. I am finally working in the entertainment industry in LA. My dream has come true."

Seeing my friend's text, I feel elated. How rare is it that someone with a real-estate background and a hidden passion for theater, gets such an incredible opportunity?

I see this kind of luck very often. A friend who is a start-up founder got reached out by an investor in Taiwan, who ended up being his mentor and gave the company much needed capital. Another got only one interview in her internship application and got in, and that place was Facebook. 

To many, they just seem to get lucky.

I think that luck always plays a role. Yet I also noticed a different pattern among all the stories I have told above.

My friend who got into the extremely selective entertainment industry started networking since her first day in college. While others were partying, she was reaching out to alumni and professionals, building a rich network that she maintains till this day. Last I checked, she still sends 5 LinkedIn requests a day, and eats lunch with different people every week. 

My start-up founder friend started writing 8 years ago, and keeps on writing to this day. His start-up idea was first a research project for 4 years, and he has since written multiple articles about it explaining his visions, his research and progress. He has tens of thousands of followers in Taiwan organically, and is one of the most knowledgeable in his field. 

My friend who got 1 interview from Facebook started prepping for the position in May, while working in her data science internship with a start-up CEO doing high impact work and Teaching Assistant for CS110, arguably one of the hardest classes in our university. Since her first year at Minerva, she has been working with data science, exploring Kaggle datasets and find different way to combine this strength with strategy, her other passion. Before her interview, I remember telling her, "If Facebook doesn't accept you, I don't think they can accept anyone.

We often see the fruits of others. We see the awards, the job offers, and fancy titles. What we don't see is years of hard work, the many seeds that they sow, the care and efforts that they put in to make it a reality. In all stories I told, it was luck that brought results. And in all these cases, success was bound to happen, sooner or later, the only question is when.

Nowadays, I admire people for a different reason. It is no longer about the fancy title or what they have achieved. What makes me admire them is consistency: the ability to do something, day in day out. Because these people are the ones who know the odds, and the secret: it is sowing seeds. It is doing things long before we see results, and doing them consistently. It is pushing for small opportunities with big breaks, and doing it continually. And it is patience. Our big break will come, if we keep going. Luck favours the prepared, afterall.
