In secondary school, when we were preparing for our O level exam, I was taught how to write a paragraph using a framework: **PEEL: Point, Example, Elaboration, and Link**. We would structure our essay and every single argument in this form, highlighting our opening line as a point, how we add an example and elaborate, and then link it together at the last line. It was really useful for helping me get good grades, but I’ve since learnt that its usefulness extends beyond essays in school, to blog posts, talks, email threads, and so on. There’s a few advantages I’ve found:

1. I need to get a point out early. 
    
    I always try to anchor my discussion/ response around a particular thought. Then everything I do would be to try and explain that thought as clearly as possible. Especially in conversation, where things can go sidetrack easily, it’s really easy to lose sight of what and why are we talking. Having an anchor at the beginning really force me to make sure I’m making a clear point, both to myself and to the person I’m speaking to. 
    
2. Concrete examples ground my thoughts. 
    
    Often, the more abstract the idea, the harder it is to follow the thought. That’s why whenever possible, I would relate it to a personal, concrete example. This helps whoever I’m talking to to imagine the picture in their heads, and relate and understand my point quickly. The goal is not to have a perfect example, but have an example as a grounding and then connecting that example back to the point, so that both people have more clarity in the conversation.
    
3. Elaboration expand on the example.
    
    Often the example alone is not enough to prove your point. It might be out of context, there’s only part of it that you need to focus on, etc. So having an elaboration afterwards is almost always necessary. Think of the example as answering the “what”, “where” and “who” question, and the elaboration is answering the “how” and “why”.
    
4. The link ties things back together.
    
    Messages get diluted, conversation stray, and even clear examples can become muddy and distract from the main point. I think everyone has experienced this when after finishing the story, we pause for a moment and say “Hm... why did I tell you this?”. If we can’t even remember our own points sometimes, it is 10x harder for others to follow us. Having a conclusion to link everything back helps make sure that my main point, hopefully now well elaborated and understood, get imprinted in the other person’s mind.
    

Let’s try it with a fun example - me describing a friend in a conversation with another friend. 

“[My friend] is just like a dog - he’s extremely loyal and always happy for you. Like when I got my first internship, when he heard the news, he screamed and lifted me up the grounds. I know it was difficult because he didn’t have an internship at that time, but if he was slightly self-conscious, he didn’t let that shown even for a second. He was just so happy for me that it makes me feel so much happier too. Isn’t that exactly what a dog does?”

Notice how this flows like a pretty natural conversation, with no explicit structure, but hidden inside is a clear **Point** (my friend is like a dog), **Example** (He is happy for me when I got the internship), **Elaboration** (He just focused on my achievement, which made me feel happier), and **Link** (back to the point about him being like a dog). So this can actually be weaved in pretty much any contexts without making it too structured. After some practice, it’s easy.

This framework is just one of many, many ways to structure my language to help another person understand me better. But more importantly, it helps me understand that good communications requires a ton of efforts. But like any other skills, it can be learnt. With each additional example, point and link, I can see my efforts bear fruits: people understand me better, I get compliments for my explanations, and more importantly, I get my message across, so we can focus on dissecting, expanding, or disproving my thoughts, instead of getting stuck in misunderstanding. 

Now that you know the secret, try using them and see how your communications change!
