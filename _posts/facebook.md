This month, I've been lucky enough to get several internship offers from various places, one of which is Facebook. After a lot of thoughts and consultation, I've decided to reject this offer, and instead will be working for Tableau (Salesforce). 

It wasn't an easy decision - there was a lot of back and forth as I think of the learning opportunity, prestige, money and connections that would be available to me in Facebook. Not to mention that it's an easier decision, where I would be with many of my friends in San Francisco, a place I'm already familiar with.

But ultimately, I made this decision for a different reason.

Recently, a friend of mine was offered an internship at British Petroleum (BP). The offer ultimately didn't go through due to visa complications, but it did make me take a step back and wonder, could I befriend with someone who works for an oil company that I know is actively hurting the planet?

"But, can't you argue the same for Facebook?", another friend asked, "Isn't it also actively hurting people by continuing with its product after research showing it affects teenagers' mental health?"

"Yes, but Facebook is not as black and white. You cannot say that it's actively hurting the world in the same way you can say for certain BP does. Also, BP is a hypocrite, it says that it's investing in renewables, but it actually still create oil drills that would work well beyond 2100."

That conversation ended there, but it got me thinking. How am I sure that Facebook is different? How am I sure that Facebook is not making the world a worse place? There's no clear study that has measured the net positive vs negative impacts that Facebook has on the world, and I don't think there will ever be. But I think, when I said that it's not as black and white with Facebook, there's a part of me that is a hypocrite.

I'm not here to shame other people for accepting an offer from Facebook. But I'm in a privilege position to be able to choose between different offers, and I have both the power, and responsibility, to work on something that I know for sure will make the world a better place, or at least, not making the world worse. I genuinely can't say that about Facebook.

The world is complex, and all our decisions are no longer black and white (I can already see counter arguments as to why it's actually bad that I'm rejecting Facebook). So really, all we can do is to make the best decision we can in the moment, based on what we think is right. I am doing this because it makes sense to me. And I'm writing this memo here to remind myself in the future, whenever decisions like this arise, to not be afraid to choose the path less taken.
