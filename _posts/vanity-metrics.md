My friend recently showed me a start-up slide deck raising its seed round. The start-up has an accumulative $2 Million in GTV. Wow, that’s a huge number, I commented, but what does GTV mean? Turns out, it’s gross transaction value, the total volume of everything going through a marketplace. While that’s still impressive, suddenly I’m a bit more doubtful. Why is that their metric of choice? Why aren’t they talking about revenue? Why is it accumulative, and not month-to-month? What about churn rate? The number was a great selling point, but it says little about how well the business is doing.

I’ve realized there’s 2 types of metrics: vanity versus real. The first type is the one that people applaud you for and talk about, and the second is what that actually matters. Usually, there’s little overlap. For a start-up, vanity metrics is often about money and valuation: this company raises $X million at $10X valuation for its seed round. While real metrics is: is this product solving a real problem for customers? For a job, it’s about brand names (FAANG) and total compensation versus whether the job brings joy and fulfillment. For dating/ relationship, it’s about title (6’’1 MBA at Berkeley/ 6’’5 graduate at Stanford/ 6’’0 SWE at Google) versus how the person makes you feel. The list goes on.

As I go through the list, there’s a few things that I notice:

1. It’s much harder to quantify real metrics. 
    
    They barely even qualify as a metric in most cases e.g. how to do actually calculate whether a job bring you fulfillment? That means it’s easier to showcase and optimize for vanity metrics. But that’s often a trap! Because it would lead us chasing for things that don’t bring us to our goal e.g. a start-up that raises millions but burn through cash, a job that makes six figure but bring now joy, a person that’s great on paper but is toxic for you.
    
2. At the same time, there’s probably a correlation between real versus vanity metric. 
    
    A start-up that raises a lot of money probably means it has a unique vantage point that might be valuable, and someone who work at FAANG probably does know at least some coding. The problem is that the correlation is probably weaker than we think. Which leads me to
    
3. There are better proxies for quantifying our real metric of interest, but it involves letting in a lot more subjective data. 
    
    For instance, evaluating a start-up might be a lot better if we ask ourselves, how many people currently have this dying problem that the start-up would solve, and how many more in the next 10 years? Or how is the team uniquely positioned to solve this problem? Both are much better metrics than money they have raised, and they can also have a lot of data points to back up (e.g. market size, iteration speed, founder’s background), but they are also a lot more subjective. People with great insights on market size might not have a MBA, but they can have a unique insight on the current market. Or there are some people that when you talk to them, you know they would make it big, even if you have little more than a gut feeling. 
    
4. It’s easy to lose sight of the real metrics. So we need to remind ourselves of them often.
    
    It’s easy to look at fancy titles or growing numbers on the chart and forget about the real reason we do anything: to solve problems, to build connections, to find enjoyment and fulfillment. While we can proxy data points and quantify whatever we can, we still need to align ourselves with a more fundamental question: does it feel right? This, in my opinion, is the hardest, and easiest question of all.
