Last year I read 62 books, exceeding my goal of 50 books for the year. A few things I did that really helped with this process:

1. I continue with the I-can-drop-any-books mentality. Because of this, I really liked most of the books I have finished, and have a hard time narrowing down the list below.
2. I re-read a lot of books. My tastes for books have narrowed quite a bit, and now a lot of books I can no longer enjoy (e.g. most self-help). But I make up for it by re-reading the ones I really love. Each time, I find myself engaging with the original concepts a lot more, and appreciating them more deeply.
3. I read a lot of physical books. While Kindle is great for reading, I find that the satisfaction of reading, underlining, writing your thoughts in a physical book is completely unmatched. I’m still travelling quite a bit at the first half of the year, but have become a lot more open to the idea of buying (used) books, reading and leaving them behind. 

Compared to last year’s favorites, this year my favorites really skewed towards non-fictions, so I put everything together instead. So, in chronological order (because ranking is hard) here’s a list of 10 books that taught me new concepts, made me cry, and challenged me in ways I didn’t expect:

1. **The Alamanack of Naval Ravikant** (Eric Josenson) was a distillation of Naval Ravikant’s thoughts and writing, a famous angel investor and cofounder of Angel List. It came at a time where my career was going well, but the rest of my life was restless and tumulous. I learnt a lot from the first section (Guide to wealth), but the second section (Guide to happiness), was the one that got me thinking the most. 
2. **Kitchen Confidential** (Anthony Bourdain) made me understand why Bourdain is so famous. He is not just a great chef, but an exceptional storyteller. I was immersed in the world of smokes and noises of the crazy life he led, and the people surrounding it. It taught me so much about craft, discipline, and love - of food and people.
3. **What I talk about when I talk about running** (Haruki Murakami) I picked up again when I caught the running bug in the summer. Now, with much more context on running, I can better appreciate Murakami’s persistence and dedication. Running a marathon is like doing most other hard things - it’s the ability to put in work in a long time, keep going even when you don’t feel like it, and to pull yourself forward, one step at a time. 
4. **Tiny habits** (BJ Fogg) was a surprising discovery, since I already read the classics on habits, Atomic Habits & The Power of Habits, so did not expect to learn anything significant. But one insight stuck with me the most: a habit becomes “sticky” when you attach positive emotional reactions to it. Not just when you do it multiple times, but when you associate positive emotions. This was a game-changer in my habit formation as I now am able to design habits much better to maintain the good ones and keep the bad ones at bay. 
5. **The road to character** (David Brooks) is a wildcard, because I picked it in an used bookstore based on the cover, having no idea that it was a Christian-based philosophy on life. But the fundamental message of the book is applies regardless of religions: we spend our lives trying to optimize for “resume” virtues like status and wealth, when the ones we should cultivate are “eulogy” virtues, such as community, kindness and humility. The book helps reshape my life values, and how to cultivate them in my life. 
6. **Antifragile** (Nassim Taleb) is another re-read. My first read was at the start of the pandemic, which already mapped well to what was happening then. This year I read this at the peak of inflation, and the start of tech layoffs, with the goal of improving my antifragility both in job search and in life. I still navigate applying all of these concepts in my personal life, but the mental framework is of huge value. 
7. **Unbowed** (Wangari Maathai) is an autobiography of Wangari, the woman who established the Green Belt Network and won a Nobel Peace Prize for her work on humanitarian and environment. Her story was inspirational, raw and real. I saw in her a strong, determined, resilient, kind, and loving woman. For a long time, I only had male role models, but it was different (the good kind) to have a woman taking the center stage. 
8. **The remains of the day** (Kazuo Ishiguro) was a masterpiece depicting the process of the internal struggle, featuring a traditional English butler going on a long ride to visit a long-time friend. Nothing much happened in the trip itself, and the narrator mostly focused on description of events and places, but I could feel the embedded emotions so vividly every step of the way. The ending absolutely broke my heart. 
9. **Come as you are** (Emily Nagoski) is a much needed refresher as I learnt a lot more about sex and sexuality, but also contains hidden gems that I didn’t know I needed, like dealing with stressors, self-confidence and emotional cycles. I get reminded that I am normal and beautiful! but also am equipped with better tools for my emotional and physical well-being. Isn’t that the best of both world? 
10. **Awareness** (Anthony de Mello) is another Christian-based book, but the tone is actually a lot closer to Buddhism. The main message is to wake up, let go, and observe. It is spiritual and so hard to describe, but one that grounds me deeply to life. 

With that being said, here are a few books goal in 2023:

- Continue with 1 book/ week, re-read books I like, and drop any books I don’t
- Engage with each book beyond reading. This could mean writing summaries or gushing about it to my friends. Or maybe implement 1-2 insights to my daily life. For fiction books, journal about how it makes me feel.
- Notice craft behind writing and ask myself, how would I write things differently?
- Continue to solicit book recommendations from friends, bookstores and libraries.
- Read more fictions.

Hope this helps you read more in 2023 & find a few gems of your own!
