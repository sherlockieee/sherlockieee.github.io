Taiwan is probably my favorite rotation city so far. Some thoughts:

1. People here are incredibly friendly, especially older people. 
2. Why are there squatting toilets everywhere???
3. Vegetarian foods are both incredibly accessible and there is so much variety in the food! I don’t think I will ever get bored here.
4. Convenient stores are a god-sent and I can’t imagine my life without it. Also the baked sweet potatoes and green tea are my two favorites. Life is good when I start my day with them.
5. I see a city that cares for its citizens and it shows in the park next door where students go to play basketball after school, grandmas and grandpas go for walk in the evenings or qigong in the morning, babysitters with kids running around in the day. 
6. Also, wow, the nature. Taipei is so green and every wall seems to be filled with plants, even the highway columns. That nature seems to be a part of the city, rather than a clear separation makes it feel more alive. Even if the color scheme is gray and the windows look like cages, I think the trees make up for it.
7. I love biking here (even if I broke my bones because of it). Ubikes (Taiwanese public bike system) are so convenient, and they are everywhere (like 7-elevens!). Walking from the MRT to our dorm is 10 minutes, when I bike it’s more like 3. Also there are beautiful bike paths along the river that I can go to decompress all of my problems.
8. Also, the public transportation in general is something else. Taipei has a hot spring on one of its MRT station. You can take a public bus to a national park (or any national parks for that matter). The High speed rail takes you from 1 end of Taiwan to the other in 2 hours, faster than if you were to drive yourself. Public transport >>>> Car. Fight me.
9. There are beautiful cafes that let you study for a long time, and open late. 
10. Taiwan is so cute! From the MRT card to the song that garbage trucks play, the city are like its people: cutiepies (but also weird, in the best way possible).
11. Seriously, on the topic of weird, we played arcade games at the night market where the players are ex-presidents of Taiwan?? And they are supposed to be sumos punching each other??? Who does that???
12. It’s hard to imagine how great my life is here, and how drastic the change will be once I go back to the US for graduation. The glamour of the city says little about what it actually is like for citizens who live there. I feel cared for, living here, in a way that I don’t find frequently in other places.

Conclusion: I will miss Taiwan a lot.
