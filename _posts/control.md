This is as much a written reflection for myself as for anyone else who's reading it.

At the time of writing, I just tested positive for a COVID test. I'm waiting for my PCR result. I have a flight to San Francisco in 7 days that, if the PCR test came back positive, will mean I have to change the flight and probably lose the ticket, which is a month's worth of salary for me. I would also need to find housing for the days where I'm supposed to be in San Francisco, but is here instead. That's another hundreds of dollars. I don't have a hot plate or anything resembling a kitchen in this place, so I don't know how my next few meals are going to look like (I'll probably order in, which will cost extra). I just feel lost, and stressed, and angry at myself, and tired.

I can't control feeling sad. I can't control the wave of emotions that is hitting me this way. I can't control the frustration and the annoyance that it has to be at possibly the worst possible time, and the aloneness that I'm feeling through it all. And I am letting myself feel all of this emotions. If I cry myself to sleep, so be it.

I can control other things. If I'm going to quarantine for the next 14 days, I can read as much as I want. I can make a plan to finallyyyy learn React testing properly and build a side project and try Remix and see what's the hype all about. I can meditate an hour a day, get into yoga again, and I can definitely guilt trip a few friends into buying me bubble tea. The world is my oyster, and it's the way I want to approach it.

Even as I wrote this, I started texting ^said friend to deliver bubble tea. I already feel better. There's something about a brief conversation with someone that always ended up lightening up my mood.

I can't control whether the test will be negative or positive. I will work it out either way. But the important thing is that, there are things in my control, and I get to focus on that.
