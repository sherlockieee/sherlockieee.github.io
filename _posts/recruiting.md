title: What I've Learnt from Recruiting Season

*Context: I just ended my recruiting season with offers from Robinhood, Brex, Intuit, Tableau (Salesforce) and Facebook, after 4 months of intense prepping. Here's a reflection of the process.*

## 1. The things people think are hard, are actually not that difficult.

Like getting into big tech, which funnily enough, gave me the easiest interviews of all the places. I used to be so scared of it that I wouldn't even apply in the first place. Looking back, I would actually advise others to start earlier - it's easier than you think. So if anyone reading needs a push to apply to their dream company, let this comment be it. 

## 2. Conversely, the things that might seem easy, are actually not.

Like writing good code. Only when I did mock interviews did I realize how easy it is to forgo good conventions for quick and easy tricks. Or explaining my thoughts process. I always thought my code makes sense, until I start doing mock interviews and realize that I can stumble and not explain fundamental concepts, which means I don't understand something enough and need to revise again. Or debugging. God is it painful.

## 3. It's never too late.

If you put your mind into it, you'll get there faster than you think.

## 4. It's the advice you've been hearing over and over again.

Nowadays, when someone ask me about technical interviews, I usually just give them two: 

1. Make sure you understand the fundamentals; and

2. Practice. 

That's it! [^1]

If it sounds simple (and repetitive), it's supposed to be! Yet from my observations, few people take the time to understand the concepts, and even fewer have the discipline to practice consistently. It's the same advice everywhere, anyone you ask, because they work!

## 5. Know the space and you're half-way there.

Throughout my preparation, I ended up doing informational interviews with roughly 10-20 people from various places (interns, working adults, etc.). Common themes emerged as I went through the list, like focus on Leetcode, do mock interviews, let others review your resume, etc. that were unclear to me previously. I would say after 5 informational interviews, I got pretty comfortable with the process, and at 10 interviews, I could start to sieve out which advices were most applicable to me. This helps me create a roadmap that ends up being very helpful when applying for big tech.

## 6. Work hard.

There's no substitute for hard work. Work smart, yes, but also work hard. That's the only way to ensure success. 

## 7. Make sure you want it.

At the end of the day, this is just one path! I chose to go through the Leetcode grind because I know as an international student, my best bet for working in the US is with big companies that have visa sponsorships, and because I want to get really good at software, these companies would have the brightest people to work with. Maybe your path is different, and be aware of that when you're working. All the points above still apply though (hopefully).

I do think, however, that because I want a big tech internship badly (sprinkled in some insecurity about not being good enough~~) and so determined to get it that I am able to put in the efforts in a way that few others could. This is important! While it is not purely motivation (and never is), the fuel definitely helps me push through a lot. And the other thing would be:

## 7. Find help, and help others.

I am so grateful that I have such a good accountability buddy, many helping hands and many mock interviews with peers. In tough days, it's what keeping me going. I really couldn't have done it by myself.

This reminds me of a quote, and I've never felt it to be more true in the last 4 months:

> If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

[^1]: To be fair, each of them warrants a very long essay on how to understand the fundamentals (what even are they), and how to practice effectively. But the point still stands. If you don't understand the fundamentals, you reach a celling and can't go higher. If you don't practice, it's a lot harder to be good at it, no matter how efficient your practice is.
