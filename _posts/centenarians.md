Living to 100 years old seem both appealing and not so much. On the one hand, who would not want to live longer? On the other, it’s hard to imagine my life as a 50-year-old (I’m not even half-way there), let alone twice that amount of time. It’s even sadder to imagine when I’m 70, fragile and living in a nursery home, unable to go running, or with Alzheimer and unable to remember even the most important people in my life. That’s why, when I found the book “The Blue Zone” for $0.99 in Goodwill, I was excited to get started.

The Blue Zone documents small areas of the world where there are an uncommonly high number of people living until they are 100 years old (centenarians), from Okinawa, Japan to Greece, Italy, Costa Rica and California. In doing so, the author draws out the commonality across cultures to suggest ways we can live longer.

There were things in the book that was pretty obvious: move more, eat less processed and more whole food, eat more plant, eat until you’re 80% full. And there are things that are surprising: drinking red wine in moderation, for instance, might be good for your health, and religion is important for a long life. 

But the biggest takeaway for me is: the details of the workout and diet doesn’t matter that much. 

This sounds a bit counterintuitive. We live in a society that counts every step we take, every calorie we put in our bodies, that argues constantly about the best diets and workout plans every other minute to try and find the perfect answer. 

But the people in the Blue Zone eat a varied diet, no region very similar to another. They eat goat milk and natto and olive oil and the occasional pork chop. They walk, garden and swim and rarely run marathons or go to the gym. Their lives vary in color. 

But they come together and live with their community. Take the concept of “moai”: a group of Japanese elders (90+) would gather every day at 3, drink tea and gossip about their village. They laugh and share stories and go their separate ways and meet again the next day. 

In addition, the centenarians often hold important roles in their community and earn respects from the youngsters. They see the significance in what they do, and they wake up every day energized for what happens next. These communities are also often faith-based, though the religions vary from Adventist Christianity to Greek Orthodox and ancestor worshipping. It’s almost as if people live longer because, *surprise*, they have a reason to live longer.

As someone who reads every nutrition book and obsess over my step count every day, I find this book refreshing. I can continue to obsess about getting my micronutrient in check, or I can spend that energy finding a good community who will be there for me through thick and thin and doing work that I love. It’s not complicated science; it’s traditional wisdom that most people take for granted. But maybe because we take for granted this wisdom, we let days and years slip by before realizing that we live without caring about the most important things. It’s a good reminder to focus on what will bring me longevity, and more importantly, happiness: purpose and community.
