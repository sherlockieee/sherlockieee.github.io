I have a reputation among my friends to be the responsible one: the ones who hand in my assignments on time (mostly) and follow through. The one who have my shit together. I was so used to this compliment that at some point, I started believing in it myself.

Until I move to my aunt’s house.

Suddenly, everything was falling apart. I was spending 5 hours a day on my phone (as my iPhone report tells me), walked probably 1,000 steps in total per day, eating junk, and most importantly, procrastinating on a lot of important work that I needed to do. It’s almost ridiculous how much a 2-hour flight difference made to my life. I went from a health guru and productivity goddess to a sloth.

And it hits home: I used to think I’m really good at being responsible, turns out I’m just really good at building safeguards. For instance, I usually have zero motivation to start working, but once I start, I can stay focused for a long time. So when living by myself, I would walk 10 minutes to a cafe, or a coworking space, and work until I’m tired. If I need extra push, I will ask a friend to cowork in advance. I cannot say no to junk food so I just don’t bring it back home. I have a really easy run route that I can literally pick up my shoes, get out of the house and start running. I have made things extremely simple for me that I don’t need to put effort to get started. 

And it’s pretty obvious why things fall apart here: I don’t have a car so I can’t go anywhere. I don’t have friends around, and my friends are also in wildly different timezones. I don’t cook for myself and there are tons of snacks in the house within an arm reach. I don’t know where to run. All these things, while small, add up that within 24 hours, I went from being productive to being my most unproductive self.

I think all these things are pretty standard - read Atomic Habits or anything similar and you will find the same advice. What’s surprising to me is how easy for others, and even myself, to think that it’s my willpower or innate ability, when in reality, it’s so much more about the environment and the system I build to keep me on top of my shit. 

It keeps me humble - I think I know myself, but in reality, I'm a product of my environment, the people I surround myself with, and so much more. But it also makes me feel more confident: I don't need to worry about losing my ability to work hard, because I never really have that ability in the first place! But if I have the right environment, and manipulate a few things right, things will be going my way.

Sure enough, the next day when I ask a friend to co-work with me remotely, I finish a lot more within a few hours than the last couple of days. I'm also looking at cafes nearby, but one step at a time.

So next time when someone asks me, “What’s your biggest strength?”, instead of saying “I’m responsible”, I should really be saying, “I’m really good at manipulating my spatial environment so I can make my lazy ass do more shit.” Ha, who knew?
